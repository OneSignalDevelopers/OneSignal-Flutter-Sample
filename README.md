# OneSignal Flutter Integreation

This repo contains a sample project integrating the OneSignal [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Flutter-SDK) into a starter Flutter targeting for Android and iOS. 

## Getting Started

There are quite a few moving pieces to get this sample to work due to the nature of Flutter and the platforms it targets.

### OneSignal

0. [Setup a OneSignal account](https://app.onesignal.com/signup) if you don't already have one.
1. Use the [OneSignal Dashboard](https://app.onesignal.com/apps) to create a new app.
2. Configure the platform you'd like to target...

### Configuring Android

I recommend starting with Android first.

0. [Create a new Firebase project](/docs/setting-up-firebase-project.md)
1. Select your app in the OneSignal dashboard.
2. Enter your Firebase info.
3. Select Flutter as your SDK.

### Configuring iOS

0. [Obtain an Apple push certficate](docs/obtaining-ios-push-cert.md)
1. Select your app in the OneSignal dashboard.
2. Navigate to settings.
3. Find and select iOS in the platform list.
4. Upload your certificate (`*.p12`).
5. Enter the passphrase you encrypted your certificate with.
6. Select Flutter as your SDK.

## Configuring Flutter project

### Update bundle identifier

Open the project in Android Studio or VS Code.

1. Find all occurrences of, `com.example.onesignal_and_flutter`
2. Replace all occurrences with the unique bunlde identifier you used in setting up iOS.
    * If you're deploying to Android only, replace the `com.example` bit of the identifier with something unique to you.

### Starting app

1. Install Flutter dependencies, `flutter pub get`
2. Install iOS dependendies. From `ios` directory, `pod install`  (required if targeting iOS)
3. Start the project. From project root, `flutter run`
